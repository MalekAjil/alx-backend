# LRUCache
This project implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) caching system in Python.
The `LRUCache` class inherits from `BaseCaching` and follows the LRU algorithm to manage cache entries.
## Requirements
- Python 3.7 
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 
- Pycodestyle 2.5
## Usage To use the `LRUCache` class,
simply import it and create an instance.
Use the `put` method to add items to the cache and the `get` method to retrieve items.
## Example
